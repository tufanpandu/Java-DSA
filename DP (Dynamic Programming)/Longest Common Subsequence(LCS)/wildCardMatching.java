//=========== Wild Card Matching (Hard Question) =========
/* 
 Given a text and wildcard pattern, implement wildcard pattern matching algorithm that finds if wildcard pattern is matched with text. The matching should cover the entire text(not partial text). The wildcard pattern can include the charcters "?" and "*"
   - '?' - Mathches any single character
   - '*' - Matches any sequence of characters(including the empty sequence)


   Text = "baaabab"
   Pattern = "**** ba****** ab"
   output:true

   Text = "baaabab"
   Pattern = "a*ab"
   output:false
